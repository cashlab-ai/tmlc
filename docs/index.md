## About the Project

Multi-label classification is a machine learning method where each data point can have multiple labels or categories. In compliance message contexts, it can classify messages by compliance topics like financial regulations, data privacy laws, or ethical guidelines.

To create a multi-label classification model, techniques such as binary relevance, classifier chains, or label powerset can be used. The training process involves preprocessing text data into numerical formats like word embeddings or bag-of-words representations. Machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks can then be applied to train the model.

Once trained, the model can predict compliance topics for new messages, outputting a list of predicted labels based on the message's features. These labels can help prioritize and triage messages based on compliance risk or severity. Multi-label classification can thus aid compliance teams in automating classification and triage processes, enhancing efficiency and accuracy while reducing the risk of violations.
